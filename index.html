                    Usually user data is used to provide personalized advertising on a subject, whether it is buying and selling products or series on a streaming service. However, we must be aware of the abusive use of this data in situations such as election advertising, because that way we would lose the democratic environment and we would have elections easily manipulated and misleading with the dissemination of <strong>“Fake News”</strong>.

                    Facebook stores a wide variety of your data, such as words you searched on the platform, subjects you interact with, your personal messages and even your location. At first, the app uses your data to customize the content you'll see, especially ads, to create a friendlier environment. However, this is not always good, as cases like the one mentioned above happen more easily. This is because it is very easy to customize an ad targeted to a particular public sphere, so that you only see what suits you best and that is already part of your reality, creating a false sense that the world is a certain way and that everyone has the same opinion as you.

                            A new book published by Cecilia Kang and Sheera Frankel, reporters for the New York Times, reveals troubling details about behind the scenes of Facebook’s security. According to the book, between January 2014 and August 2015, more than 52 engineers on the social network, had their jobs terminated due to data breaches. While most simply looked at the information, one of them accessed location data to find out where the person he shared a trip to Europe with decided to stay after a fight between the two. In another case, one of the company’s engineers took advantage of his administrator privileges to access the profile of a woman he had dated a few days ago, but who stopped responding to his messages. It was even possible to access Facebook Messenger messages and deleted photos. The dismissed professionals were detected by an alarm system present on the work machines provided by the company.

                            The CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, used data from social network users as a bargaining chip, benefiting its allies and controlling competitors. This information is in a leaked document of about 4 thousand pages obtained by NBC News. According to the leaks, the period in which Zuckerberg most used such data for his own benefit occurred between 2011 and 2015. The leaks show that Facebook granted the Amazon extended access to user data because the Jeff Bezos was spending a lot of money on social media advertising at the time. However, the same measure was not adopted for a messaging application that was on the rise and was considered a possible competitor. During these invasions of privacy, Zuckerberg encouraged private conversation on the platform. In contrast, the company was involved in a rewards scheme, which included spending on advertising and data sharing. About 400 pages out of the 4,000 have been previously reported and cited by members of the British Parliament after the scandal involving Cambridge Analytica.

            <h1 class="title text--size-32px margin_b-20px">Conclusion</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                With all this information we can conclude that Facebook, like many other software from companies that collect user data, is not 100% secure. Therefore, it is necessary to pay more attention to the data acquired by these programs, to always know what data they collect, how that data is being used, and whether it is actually being used in the way mentioned. With this, we can avoid being manipulated and having our worldview distorted.
